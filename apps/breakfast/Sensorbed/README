sp-local-async.py and sp-remote-async.py are the old code that works with the
proxy code in the tinyos-telos-monitor directory.

For the lastest code, please use the code in version2 directory and
tinyos-telos-monitor_version2 directory.

----
The server application can be found under 'version2'. MIB.py reads
serial packets, MIB_UART_ID.py reads raw uart data streams (e.g.
unbuffered serial printf)

tinyos-telos-monitor_version2 has instructions for building OpenWRT
images and cross-compiling the bootstrap loader used by the bacon
mote.

There are a number of expect scripts under the openwrt directory that
may be useful for automating manual tasks (such as updating code on
each NSLU, rebooting NSLUs, copying files to every NSLU)

This directory includes the mote-side base station code for
interacting with the network.

The python hooks for communication can be found under
apps/breakfast/tools/Life under the tools.cx package, particularly
CXController and CXMoteIF.  The scripts in
this directory are for older versions and should not be used: use
apps/breakfast/tools/Life/Dashboard* to interact with the basestation.
